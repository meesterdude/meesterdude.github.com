<p><blockquote><p>The next results were even more impressive. The participants were asked to listen to some stories and answer questions an hour later. Without the chance to rest, they could recall just 7% of the facts in the story; with the rest, this jumped to 79% – an astronomical 11-fold increase in the information they retained. The researchers also found a similar, though less pronounced, benefit for healthy participants in each case, boosting recall between 10 and 30%.</p><footer><strong>bbc</strong> <cite><a href='http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20180208-an-effortless-way-to-strengthen-your-memory'>www.bbc.com/future/story/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>Fascinating read. Introducing quiet time after learning dramatically improves retention. But while a simple thing to do, it's potentially difficult for people to do nothing for minutes on end. The article recommends 10-15 minutes, but i suspect shorter intervals would be effective as well, in the 3-7 minute range. If you're trying to digest a lot of new information, doing more frequent and shorter rests may be more realistic. As what works best is bound to vary from person to person, it's best to experiment with a stopwatch and see how long you really need.</p>

<p><blockquote><p>The KPTI patches to mitigate Meltdown can incur massive overhead, anything from 1% to over 800%. Where you are on that spectrum depends on your syscall and page fault rates, due to the extra CPU cycle overheads, and your memory working set size, due to TLB flushing on syscalls and context switches.</p><footer><strong>brendangregg.com</strong> <cite><a href='http://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2018-02-09/kpti-kaiser-meltdown-performance.html'>www.brendangregg.com/blog/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>Ouch.</p>

<p>My Virtual Machines aged 5 years overnight; the performance hit has been more than the highest estimates of 30%. But I never thought the fallout could introduce penalties as high as 800%. Crazy.</p>

<p><blockquote><p>Google has said that it has tested the productivity of remote teams and on-site teams and found no difference in performance.</p><footer><strong>zdnet.com</strong> <cite><a href='http://www.zdnet.com/article/no-telecommuting-allowed-why-is-google-investing-billions-of-dollars-in-office-buildings/'>www.zdnet.com/article/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>This deserves to be highlighted, as many companies hesitate to embrace remote work out of fear it will impact performance. Even if its a 1:1 for google, it makes a huge impact on the quality of life its workers experience.</p>

<p><blockquote><p>Google doesn't want its engineers in local coffee shops hooking up with others from other companies and plotting a Google-killer. The more it can keep its people company men and company women -- the better.</p><footer><strong>zdnet.com</strong> <cite><a href='http://www.zdnet.com/article/no-telecommuting-allowed-why-is-google-investing-billions-of-dollars-in-office-buildings/'>www.zdnet.com/article/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>The better for stockholders of Google.</p>

<title type="html"><![CDATA[The most undervalued indicator for hiring great developers]]></title>

<id>http://meesterdude.github.com/entries/the-most-undervalued-indicator-for-hiring-great-developers</id>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hiring developers is a tough problem, and there are lots of efforts to try and measure the skill set of a candidate, but most are either entirely faulty or only paint a partial picture.</p>

<p>But there is one indicator you can use that tells you close to everything you need to know about a candidate, an indicator that most shops overlook when evaluating applicants...</p>

<!--more-->


<h1>The Best Indicator is Open Source</h1>

<h2>It means working in the open</h2>

<p>All the code written is available to see - what the developer did or did not do. The mistakes they made, they fix they applied, it's all out there to be seen by all.</p>

<h2>It means collaborating with others</h2>

<p>Either reviewing and accepting PR's or submitting them to other projects - you can gain insight to how a developer gives or responds to feedback, what they are like to disagree with or brainstorm with, and how they keep the ball rolling for work that may stall.</p>

<h2>It demonstrates engineering</h2>

<p>It means they are intimately involved in a problem space, and are working close with the tooling or technology that they see where it can be better. Or if it's an entirely new project, it shows their ability to identify a problem and properly engineer and package a solution.</p>

<h2>It reveals planning &amp; organization</h2>

<p>What features did they implement and which ones did they skip? Are github issues being managed, are PRs being reviewed? Is there any kind of documentation? is the code easy enough to reason about? these are all questions you can get insight into when looking over the Open Source work of a developer.</p>

<h2>It means they're part of the community</h2>

<p>They are giving back in some way, having benefited from the works of other open source projects, they now seek to contribute back their own effort. But it also means playing a part in a larger dialog of technology, features and tooling. It means they're able and willing to share their efforts with others and take the time to make their work available for the community. A small gesture, but one that involves a significant amount of work.</p>

<p>If you're looking to hire developers, take a closer look at what their open source contributions reveal about who they are and how they work.</p>

<h4>This post is indirectly a response to <a href="http://blog.bloomca.me/2018/02/04/spa-is-not-silver-bullet.html">SPA is not a silver bullet</a></h4>

<p>Delivering applications to users has always been tough, especially if you try to keep them up to date with changes and improvements. Advances in the web allows companies to deliver the latest version of their software directly to users. It's allowed for the creation of countless E-stores, games, and desktop publishing software. But even still, it is not without it's complexities. There are ever evolving issues of complexity, maintainability, &amp; security to account for; in addition to feature development and staying nimble.</p>

<p>Before Ruby on Rails, there was coldfusion, custom PHP incarnations, VB.net, java and all other manner of crazy. I remember One of the first codebases I saw; a custom PHP app a fellow student in highschool had created for our AV club. I still remember the hardcoded SQL calls, complete with hardcoded credentials, embedded throughout the pages. Oh, how far we have come!</p>

<p>Sure, these solutions all render out a web page - one of the great levelers of the web - but working on them was often nightmarish. There were no tests, no staging environments, all development was done on the server and backups were a file copy. Naturally, these codebases decayed and became neglected but still used; We've all seen the horrendously outdated sites we sometimes need to use when interacting with the government.</p>

<p>As an industry we've identified a lot of best practices to help a codebase to be maintainable. Patterns that appear over and over again, or best practices procedurally.</p>

<p>Users have also come to expect native applications for their platforms as well, which can mean feature development takes 3 times as long to complete if you have custom codebases for each platform.</p>

<p>And lastly, productivity and effectiveness matter. Squashing bugs and creating new features needs to keep happening when you're business is software or runs on it.</p>

<h2>Rails is good for all of that</h2>

<p>Rails makes developing web applications faster and maintainable. It places emphasis on developer happiness, and using tools &amp; solutions that enable effective feature development. Once you have the environment setup, going from nothing to a web application you can actually start using functionally can be done with a couple of command line incarnations if your needs are CRUD based (most are!). Additional libraries (gems) let you further expand your app behavior, and equally you can roll your own solutions when called for.</p>

<p>It's also not afraid to break things for the sake of improvement. Backwards compatibility matters for some frameworks, but in the evolving web it's best to stay with what's current, secure or performant as browsers and technology evolve. This attitude is also what makes Rails secure: doing the "secure" thing is the default behavior, updates regularly include bugfixes or advisors to be aware of. Rails also request forgery protection, SQL sanitation, File upload and more right out of the box. An important caveat here is that updates often require (or at least encourage) changing your codebase is at each update - but that's the trade off you make to keep up with best practices.</p>

<p>But perhaps importantly to the point of this post, is that Rails lets a small team ship web and native experiences to all major desktop and mobile platforms, reusing most of the code that's already been written. By wrapping webviews in native navigation and using caching (also provided by Rails) you can create a seamless user experience - free of weird interface delays or screen flashes; while still doing most of your feature development in the Rails stack and instantly delivering updates to users for all platforms. Rails lets you optimize your app to create fast response times - as fast as 20ms (the fastest i've seen in production)</p>

<p>Rails is also quite flexible, featuring a set of very well thought opinions, but always have the option to do things differently. And if you need to start building out an API, or doing realtime websockets, or delivering more javascript-rich experiences, or scale up to support a lot of users; Rails can happily oblige.</p>

<h2>Can Rails scale? Shopify handles over 80,000 requests per second riding on Rails</h2>

<p>And those well thought out opinions, those sane defaults that Rails ships with? Makes for some highly maintainable codebases. Everything has a place, everyone knows and agrees (generally) where those places are and are not, and breaking the rules is easy unless it's ill-advised (like strong parameter protections). Even code that you wrote years ago can still make sense - no small feat!</p>

<p>For Ruby on Rails to facilitate teams of all sizes such speedy delivery of tested &amp; responsive applications across all major web/mobile/desktop platforms, makes it the silver bullet framework of development if there ever was one. The productivity, effectiveness and maintainability it enables remains unmatched in other development solutions in software.</p>
