<h4>This post is indirectly a response to <a href="http://blog.bloomca.me/2018/02/04/spa-is-not-silver-bullet.html">SPA is not a silver bullet</a></h4>

<p>Delivering applications to users has always been tough, especially if you try to keep them up to date with changes and improvements. Advances in the web allows companies to deliver the latest version of their software directly to users. It's allowed for the creation of countless E-stores, games, and desktop publishing software. But even still, it is not without it's complexities. There are ever evolving issues of complexity, maintainability, &amp; security to account for; in addition to feature development and staying nimble.</p>

<p>Before Ruby on Rails, there was coldfusion, custom PHP incarnations, VB.net, java and all other manner of crazy. I remember One of the first codebases I saw; a custom PHP app a fellow student in highschool had created for our AV club. I still remember the hardcoded SQL calls, complete with hardcoded credentials, embedded throughout the pages. Oh, how far we have come!</p>

<p>Sure, these solutions all render out a web page - one of the great levelers of the web - but working on them was often nightmarish. There were no tests, no staging environments, all development was done on the server and backups were a file copy. Naturally, these codebases decayed and became neglected but still used; We've all seen the horrendously outdated sites we sometimes need to use when interacting with the government.</p>

<p>As an industry we've identified a lot of best practices to help a codebase to be maintainable. Patterns that appear over and over again, or best practices procedurally.</p>

<p>Users have also come to expect native applications for their platforms as well, which can mean feature development takes 3 times as long to complete if you have custom codebases for each platform.</p>

<p>And lastly, productivity and effectiveness matter. Squashing bugs and creating new features needs to keep happening when you're business is software or runs on it.</p>

<h2>Rails is good for all of that</h2>

<p>Rails makes developing web applications faster and maintainable. It places emphasis on developer happiness, and using tools &amp; solutions that enable effective feature development. Once you have the environment setup, going from nothing to a web application you can actually start using functionally can be done with a couple of command line incarnations if your needs are CRUD based (most are!). Additional libraries (gems) let you further expand your app behavior, and equally you can roll your own solutions when called for.</p>

<p>It's also not afraid to break things for the sake of improvement. Backwards compatibility matters for some frameworks, but in the evolving web it's best to stay with what's current, secure or performant as browsers and technology evolve. This attitude is also what makes Rails secure: doing the "secure" thing is the default behavior, updates regularly include bugfixes or advisors to be aware of. Rails also request forgery protection, SQL sanitation, File upload and more right out of the box. An important caveat here is that updates often require (or at least encourage) changing your codebase is at each update - but that's the trade off you make to keep up with best practices.</p>

<p>But perhaps importantly to the point of this post, is that Rails lets a small team ship web and native experiences to all major desktop and mobile platforms, reusing most of the code that's already been written. By wrapping webviews in native navigation and using caching (also provided by Rails) you can create a seamless user experience - free of weird interface delays or screen flashes; while still doing most of your feature development in the Rails stack and instantly delivering updates to users for all platforms. Rails lets you optimize your app to create fast response times - as fast as 20ms (the fastest i've seen in production)</p>

<p>Rails is also quite flexible, featuring a set of very well thought opinions, but always have the option to do things differently. And if you need to start building out an API, or doing realtime websockets, or delivering more javascript-rich experiences, or scale up to support a lot of users; Rails can happily oblige.</p>

<h2>Can Rails scale? Shopify handles over 80,000 requests per second riding on Rails</h2>

<p>And those well thought out opinions, those sane defaults that Rails ships with? Makes for some highly maintainable codebases. Everything has a place, everyone knows and agrees (generally) where those places are and are not, and breaking the rules is easy unless it's ill-advised (like strong parameter protections). Even code that you wrote years ago can still make sense - no small feat!</p>

<p>For Ruby on Rails to facilitate teams of all sizes such speedy delivery of tested &amp; responsive applications across all major web/mobile/desktop platforms, makes it the silver bullet framework of development if there ever was one. The productivity, effectiveness and maintainability it enables remains unmatched in other development solutions in software.</p>

<title type="html"><![CDATA[3 words that changed me]]></title>

<updated>2017-03-21T00:22:00-04:00</updated>
<id>http://meesterdude.github.com/entries/3-words-that-changed-me</id>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Words I've known, but did not understand or truly appreciate.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>It's not every day that a single, common word can change who you are. At least I imagine it isn't - I admit there might be people out there who see a word like "insulator" and become sheep herders - but I don't think this is such a case.</p>

<h2>Listen</h2>

<p>What does it mean, to listen? the absence of my mouth not moving? that's a simple enough definition, and the one I had for a while. But when you dive deeper, it's more than that.</p>

<p>To listen is to be quiet - verbally, and in mind. You can't listen when you're being strategic in your head about how to prove the other person wrong.</p>

<p>To listen is to be intently curious and unbiased in what you see - no matter how much you agree or disagree. The desire to understand outweighs the desire to judge. When you have a question, it's to know more, not to allude or infer.</p>

<p>And the best listeners are not tea cups you fill up with information - but mirrors that reflect what they observe - offering room for dispute on the facts, allowing them to better understand the other party.</p>

<h2>Cherish</h2>

<p>Growing up, I never understood a particular word that gets thrown around quite a lot in daily life. Certainly a function of my upbringing and experiences - I always felt the word "love" was hollow, an empty threat of compassion. Many of the least favorite people in my life had loved me - and expressed so in very creative ways.</p>

<p>But i think love makes a lot more sense, when paired with cherish. If love is the theory, cherish is the action. Of course you love your wife, your kids, your close friends; you would do anything for them, and maybe you already do. But love without cherishment is a campfire with no warmth.</p>

<p>Ironically, A great way to cherish is also to listen.</p>

<h2>Commitment</h2>

<p>I have a lot of goals, interests, ideas, todos, projects. I think a lot of us do. I've naturally accumulated them over the years in varying forms. Many I made progress on, and many more I did not.</p>

<p>But commitments. What do I have of those? I have a lease, which is a form of commitment, and a few other contracts and agreements.</p>

<p>But personally? What are mine? What have they ever been? It's not a word thats been in my vernacular, as a descriptor for a given interest, project, or idea. I've had many <a href="http://paidtoexist.com/go-all-out/">interests</a>, but no commitments.</p>

<p>What does it mean to be committed? It means accepting a fundamental change to who you are - changing your DNA as a person, flamboyantly. You have a mission and everything about you is geared towards it. The answer to every distraction becomes "I have a commitment".</p>

<p>People who are interested join the army reserves.
People who are committed join the army.</p>

<title type="html"><![CDATA[Upgrading rails to use strong_params automatically]]></title>
<link href="http://meesterdude.github.com/entries/upgrading-rails-to-use-strong-params-automatically/"/>
<updated>2015-11-30T08:15:00-05:00</updated>
<id>http://meesterdude.github.com/entries/upgrading-rails-to-use-strong-params-automatically</id>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you need to upgrade a rails app to rely on strong_params, getting all the attributes sorted out can be tedious and painful. But here I'll share with you a method that you can use to have most of the work done automatically. All you have to do is exercise your site, or have your test suite do it.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Put the code (below) in <code>ApplicationController</code> and set a before_filter like <code>before_filter :install_strong_params, only: [:create, :update]</code>.</p>

<p>This code, when temporarily used within your project, will rewrite your controllers to use strong_params. It is not intelligent, and you may find you need to tweak the code or its output for it to work for your codebase; but it should carry you most of the way at least.</p>

<p>If you need to debug, uncomment the line that adds a params comment to the bottom of the controller.</p>

<p>Once your app has been upgraded, you should remove the code.</p>

<h2>Assumptions</h2>

<ul>
<li>a blank line preceeding the last line the controller, which should be an 'end' (typical for most apps)</li>
<li>existing create/update code is written using the symbol (params[:user] vs params['user'])</li>
<li>the first hash value found among the params is the one to use for strong_params (typical for most rails apps)</li>
<li>the params being submitted represent everything that should be allowed (not always the case with specs)</li>
</ul>


<h2>The Code</h2>

<p>```
 def install_strong_params</p>

<pre><code>path = self.class.instance_methods(false).map { |m| self.class.instance_method(m).source_location.first}.uniq.first
lines = File.open(path).read.lines
name, hash = params.detect{|k,v| v.is_a?(Hash) }
return true if hash.nil?
return true if lines.detect{|l| l.include?("#{name}_params")} # abort if already replaced
has_private = lines.detect{|l| l.include?('  private')}
# insert method defition at second to last line
lines[-2] = %Q^#{"  private \n\n" if !has_private}  def #{name}_params
params.require(:#{name}).permit(#{hash.keys.collect(&amp;:to_sym).to_s[1..-2]})
</code></pre>

<p>  end\n\n^</p>

<pre><code># lines[-1] = "end\n\n# #{params}" # uncomment to write params as comment at bottom of controller
lines.each_with_index do |l,i|
  lines[i] = l.gsub("params[:#{name}]", "#{name}_params") if l.include?("params[:#{name}]")
end
File.open(path, 'w+') { |file| file.write(lines.join) }
</code></pre>

<p>  end
```</p>
