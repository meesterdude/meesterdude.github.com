      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hide the files you don't normally work on with the Sublime Text 2 Project feature. Includes example for Ruby on Rails.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Background</h2>

<p>I work on Ruby on Rails sites in ST2 in my day to day work. For bigger projects, its easy to get lost in the files and folders. There are generally 3 levels of view that we want to achieve:</p>

<ol>
<li>files you work on often</li>
<li>files you work on rarely</li>
<li>files that you never touch</li>
</ol>


<p>So with Projects in ST2, we can change what level of view we have, by selectively filtering out files and folders. Most of the time, you'll want to be at #1, sometimes you'll need to drop down to #2, and once in a blue moon drop down to #3.</p>

<h2>Business</h2>

<p>The below file is an example of #1 for a Ruby on Rails project. I'll leave #2 up to you to sort out, use this as a template. #3 for me would be the default project view, such as opening the directory directly; but you may want to craft something for that perspective as well.</p>

<p>Of note: this moves the 'migrate' folder out of 'db' and makes it a top level item, outside of the project folder. I feel it makes it easier to work on that way, but that's purely my preference.</p>

<p>Put this file in the root of your project with a name like "simple.sublime-project" then open it from the 'Project' menu.</p>
