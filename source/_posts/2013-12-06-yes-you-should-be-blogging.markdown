We all have things worth sharing
<!--more-->
On this blog, I don't have visitor tracking, and I don't have comments. To me, what matters is sharing whatever you've got to share, big and small. Everything else is secondary.

It doesn't matter what industry you're in, or how much you know. In fact, the less you know, the more you should blog about your experience and findings. And the more you know, the more you have to share.

You don't need to write volumes. Posts don't take a lot of time, and if you put just 5 minutes a day into a post, you could surely pump out a weekly post or more, which is more than you're probably doing now.

If you're not sure what to write about, try writing down ideas for posts when they come to you; or looking out for things that might be interesting or worth sharing. Also, Write posts that would be useful or interesting to you, or ARE useful to you. Several of mine are that, for me.

I use [github pages](http://pages.github.com) to host my site for free, and [octopress](http://octopress.org) to publish. Simple, lightweight and no database to backup; everything is kept as files.

With the new year almost here, what better new years resolution to commit to and then later break than to blog? It's cheaper than a gym membership, and there are no cancellation fees.
