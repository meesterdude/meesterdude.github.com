{% blockquote insideintercom http://insideintercom.io/what-does-feature-creep-look-like/ %}
When you have any type of long tail of features that have little usage, you’ve gone off course, or your strategy is “build everything that everyone wants”. The latter might sound crazy, but products like Microsoft Word have very done well with that plan. But you’re probably not building Microsoft Word. If you want a well defined product, you must be comfortable killing features.
{% endblockquote %}

Great tip. Most of the time, you can and should drop features. But sometimes, it's appropriate to take the Microsoft Word path (though I'd argue even then, you can probably slim down the features)
